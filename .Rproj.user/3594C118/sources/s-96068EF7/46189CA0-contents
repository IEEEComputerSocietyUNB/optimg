Description: This package is a general purpose tool for helping users to implement
             gradient descent methods for function optimization. Currently, the
             Steepest 2-Groups Gradient Descent and the Adaptive Moment Estimation
             (Adam) are the methods implemented. Other methods will be implemented
             in the future.
